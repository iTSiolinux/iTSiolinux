# Isaac - Passionate Programmer 🚀

Hey there! I'm Isaac, and I'm on a coding journey through different languages. My ultimate goal? A future in coding (and maybe world domination, who knows? 😁).

## About Me
- 💻 **Coding Enthusiast**: I've dabbled in Python, primarily using the Flask web-server framework. I've also explored the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. Currently, I'm engrossed in Java, specifically Minecraft plugins. If only there were simpler ways to register commands in Paper Dev 1.20!

- 💔 **Windows Software Critique**: I have a love-hate relationship with Windows software. I can't help but frown at the idea of paying for what could be free services. Money should go into computer hardware and products that truly deserve it.

- 💭 **Dreaming of a Free Internet**: My dream? An internet where access is free, and you only pay for the hardware (plus those rare gems that are worth every cent).

- 📚 **School Days**: I'm also in school, learning the ropes of C# in computer science. And yes, I'm looking at you, Microsoft (C# might not be my favorite, but hey, we're making it work).

Join me on this exciting coding adventure, and let's see where the future takes us! 🌟
